## Contents
- 6 white marbles  
- 8 grey marbles  
- 10 black marbles  
- 61 rings

---

## Aim of the Game
You must try to capture **one of the following combinations**:
- 3 marbles of each color, **or**
- 4 white marbles, **or**
- 5 grey marbles, **or**
- 6 black marbles.

The **winner** is the first player to achieve any of these goals.

---

## Preparation
1. There are **61 rings** in total.  
   To play the **basic game**, use only **37 rings**. The remaining 24 rings are used for advanced play (see *Expanded Board*).
2. Arrange the 37 rings into a **hexagonal game board**.
3. Place all marbles beside the board as a **shared pool** — these marbles belong to **both players**.
4. Draw lots to decide who plays first.

> 💡 **Note:** The marbles are shared — neither player owns specific colors.

---

## Gameplay Overview
On your turn, you must perform **one** of the two possible moves:
1. **Place a marble** on the board and then **remove a ring**.
2. **Capture one or more marbles**.

After completing your move, your opponent takes their turn.

---

## Move Type 1: Placing a Marble
1. Select **any marble** from the pool.  
   You may choose any color and place it on **any vacant ring**.
2. After placing a marble, you must **remove an empty ring** from the **edge** of the board.  
   - The ring must be **vacant** (no marble).  
   - It must be possible to remove it **without disturbing** other rings.  
3. If no edge rings can be removed safely, **you skip removing a ring** — your turn ends after placing the marble.
4. Stack removed rings aside (they can hold captured marbles later).

> Each placement and ring removal together count as **one complete move**.

---

## Move Type 2: Capturing Marbles
Capturing is **compulsory** if possible.

1. You must **jump over an adjacent marble** into an empty space directly beyond it — like checkers.  
2. You may jump **in any direction**, provided the landing ring is empty.  
3. The color of marbles **does not matter**. You may capture with or over **any color**.  
4. If you can make multiple jumps in one sequence, you **must** continue until no more jumps are possible.  
5. If multiple capture paths exist, you may choose which to perform.  
6. A capturing sequence (one or more jumps) counts as your **entire turn** — you may not place a marble or remove a ring afterward.

---

## Isolating Marbles
1. If your move results in one or more rings being **isolated** (disconnected from the main board), you may **claim all marbles** on those isolated rings.  
2. You can only claim an isolated group if **none** of its rings are vacant.  
3. Isolated captures are **not compulsory** but occur **as a result of a move** (they are not separate actions).

> it is absolutely possible (and common in real play) to isolate a region that still has empty rings inside it.
However, the players never gain those marbles; that region is considered non-scoring and inaccessible for the remainder of the game.
> marbles in isolated regions are not reusable once disconnected — even if both the shared pool and captured pool are empty.
> They stay on the board as inert pieces, unplayable and uncapturable, until the game ends.

| Source of Marbles           | Usable? | Notes |
|------------------------------|:--------:|-------|
| Shared pool                  | ✅       | Normal use during the main phase of play. |
| Your captured marbles        | ✅       | Used only after the shared pool becomes empty. |
| Opponent’s captured marbles  | ❌       | Never usable — ownership is exclusive. |
| Marbles in isolated regions  | ❌       | Permanently inaccessible once disconnected from the main board. | 

---

## End of the Game
The game ends immediately when one player has:
- 3 marbles of each color, **or**
- 4 white marbles, **or**
- 5 grey marbles, **or**
- 6 black marbles.

That player is the **winner**.

---

## Special Cases
1. If the **pool is empty**, continue playing with your **captured marbles**.
   You may play any color from your collection, just as from the pool.
2. If the **entire board becomes occupied** before a win condition is met, the **player making the last move** wins and claims all remaining marbles.
3. If both players repeat the same sequence of moves indefinitely, the game is a **tie**.

---

## Player Immobilization and Loop Detection

### Case 1: Single Player Immobilized
- If a player has no legal moves (no marbles to play, no captures possible), their turn is **automatically skipped** (they "pass").
- The opponent continues playing until:
  - They also cannot move, or
  - They win via standard marble combination.
- **No penalty** for being unable to move.

### Case 2: Both Players Immobilized
- When neither player can move (consecutive passes), the game **ends immediately**.
- Winner is determined by checking standard victory conditions:
  - 3 marbles of each color, **or**
  - 4 white, **or**
  - 5 grey, **or**
  - 6 black.
- If neither player has met a win condition, the game is a **tie**.

### Case 3: Infinite Loop Detection
- If the last 2 move-pairs (4 total moves) exactly match the preceding 2 move-pairs, an infinite loop is detected.
- The game ends immediately in a **tie**.
- This prevents players from repeating the same sequence indefinitely.

## Expanded Board
After mastering the 37-ring board, you can expand to larger boards:

| Configuration | Added Rings | Description              |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 48 rings      | +11         | Tournament configuration |
| 61 rings      | +24         | Large configuration      |
- You **do not need extra marbles**; the win conditions remain unchanged.


- The 37 ring board is a regular hexagon with D6 symmetry. Side length is 4 rings.
- The 48 ring board is an irregular hexagon with D3 symmetry. Side lengths are 5-4-5-4-5-4 rings.
- The 61 ring board is a regular hexagon with D6 symmetry. Side length is 5 rings.

> ⚠️ Expanding too soon makes the game slower and less dynamic — it’s recommended only for experienced players.

---

## Tournament Rules
1. Tournament play uses a board with **at least 48 rings** (up to 61 with Potentials).  
2. **Touch rules:**
   - Once you select a marble from the pool, you **must play it**.  
   - Once a marble **touches a ring**, you must place it there.  
   - Once you **touch a removable ring** at the edge, you must remove it.
3. Capturing remains **compulsory**.  
   If a player fails to capture when possible, their opponent may **force them to undo their move**, including replacing any removed ring.

---

## Blitz Variant
A faster, more aggressive version of the game.

- Board: 37 rings  
- Marbles:  
  - 5 white
  - 7 grey  
  - 9 black  
- Win by capturing:
  - 2 marbles of each color, **or**
  - 3 white, **or**
  - 4 grey, **or**
  - 5 black marbles.

> Designed for quick, tactical play. Games are short and unforgiving.

---

## Summary of Key Principles
- Marbles belong to **both players**.
- Capturing is **mandatory** when available.
- The board **shrinks** every turn.
- Isolating connected groups can lead to **strategic captures**.
- The game rewards **sacrifice**, **timing**, and **control**.

## Notation

The official ZÈRTZ notation system follows the standard defined at [http://www.gipf.com/zertz/notations/notation.html](http://www.gipf.com/zertz/notations/notation.html).

### Coordinate System
- **Columns**: Lowercase letters `a` through `g` (for 37-ring board)
  - 61-ring boards use `a` through `j` (skipping `i`)
- **Rows**: Numbers counted from bottom upward (e.g., `a1` is at the bottom of column `a`)
- **Example coordinate**: `d4`

### Marble Colors
Marble colors are represented by **uppercase** letters:
- **W** = White
- **G** = Grey (or Gray)
- **B** = Black

### Placement Moves
Format: `[Color][Destination][,Removed Ring]`

**Examples:**
- `Wd4` - Place white marble on d4, no ring removed
- `Bd7,b2` - Place black marble on d7, remove ring at b2

### Capture Moves
Format: `x [Source][Captured Color][Destination]`

**Examples:**
- `x e3Wg3` - Capture from e3 to g3, capturing white marble at f3
- `x d1Gd3Wd5` - Multi-jump capture

### Isolation Captures
When a placement causes isolation, the notation shows the isolated marbles after an `x`:

**Format:** `[Placement] x [Color][Position]...`

**Example:**
- `Bd7,b2 x Wa1Wa2` - Place black on d7, remove b2, capture isolated white marbles at a1 and a2

### Pass
A pass is represented by a single hyphen: `-`

### Move Sequence Example
```
Wd4,d1
Ge5,c3
Bf6,d2
x c2We4
-
```

This represents:
1. White on d4, remove d1
2. Grey on e5, remove c3
3. Black on f6, remove d2
4. Capture from c2 to e4, capturing white at d3
5. Pass
