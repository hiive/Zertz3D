REPETITION MODE RESULTS
================================================================================

Configuration #1:
  Hyperparameters:
    Exploration constant: 0.350
    FPU reduction: 0.500
    Max depth: Full game
    Progressive widening: Yes (constant=12.0)
    RAVE: No

  Statistics over 100 repetitions:
    Mean win rate:    87.60% ± 3.16%
    Median win rate:  87.00%
    Mode win rate:    86.00% (occurred 16 times)
    Min/Max:          80.00% / 95.00%
    Quartiles:        Q1=86.00%, Q3=90.00%
    95% CI:           [86.97%, 88.23%]
    Avg time/game:    0.501s ± 0.025s

  Win Rate Distribution (n=100):
    80.0%:   1 rep  ( 1.0%)
    81.0%:   2 reps ( 2.0%)
    82.0%:   3 reps ( 3.0%)
    83.0%:   4 reps ( 4.0%)
    84.0%:   6 reps ( 6.0%)
    85.0%:   5 reps ( 5.0%)
    86.0%:  16 reps (16.0%) ← Mode
    87.0%:  14 reps (14.0%) ← Median
    88.0%:  13 reps (13.0%)
    89.0%:  10 reps (10.0%)
    90.0%:   7 reps ( 7.0%)
    91.0%:   8 reps ( 8.0%)
    92.0%:   4 reps ( 4.0%)
    93.0%:   2 reps ( 2.0%)
    94.0%:   4 reps ( 4.0%)
    95.0%:   1 rep  ( 1.0%)

  Interpretation:
    - The configuration achieves approximately 88% win rate against random play
    - With 95% confidence, the true win rate is between 87.0% and 88.2%
    - Most common result is 86% (16 out of 100 runs)
    - The distribution shows reasonable consistency with std dev of 3.16%
    - Performance is notably lower than the run-quick-test result of 94%
      (possibly due to different random seeds or game variance)
