# Zertz3D TODO and Improvement Suggestions

## Code Quality Improvements

### ZertzRenderer


### ZertzBoard
1. Check for debugging imports
   - Verify no pdb.set_trace() or similar debug code in production

2. Consider state layer documentation improvements
   - Current constants are well-defined (RING_LAYER, MARBLE_LAYERS, etc.)
   - Could add docstrings to explain the layer system more clearly

3. Simplify symmetry operations (optional)
   - Methods accept state=None but always copy - could simplify the interface
   - Lines: 599-626

4. Action translation methods (optional)
   - mirror_action and rotate_action have nested loops and could benefit from helper methods
   - Lines: 628-697

## Feature Ideas
- Add game statistics tracking
- Network multiplayer support
