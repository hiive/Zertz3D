"""
Tests for isolated region handling according to official ZÃ¨rtz rules.

Key Rules:
1. If a move isolates rings, you MAY claim marbles on those rings
2. BUT ONLY IF all rings in the isolated region have marbles (no vacant rings)
3. If isolated region has ANY vacant rings: marbles are NOT captured (the region simply remains on the board)
